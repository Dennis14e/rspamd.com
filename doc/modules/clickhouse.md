# Clickhouse module
{:.no_toc}

Clickhouse module pushes a variety of message-related metadata to an instance of [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.yandex/), an open-source column-oriented DBMS useful for realtime analytics. Information that could be collected includes: senders/recipients/scores of scanned messages and metadata such as DKIM/DMARC/bayes/fuzzy status & information about URLs and attachments.

You can also use [Redash](https://redash.io) to build your own analytical board using this module (similar to Elastic + Kibana).

## Module Configuration

Example configuration shown below, for the minimum working configuration you need to define Clickhouse servers:

~~~ucl
# local.d/clickhouse.conf

# Push update when 1000 records are collected (1000 if unset) (until 2.1, see limits section below for >2.1)
limit = 1000;
# IP:port of Clickhouse server ("localhost:8123" if unset)
server = "localhost:8123";
# Timeout to wait for response (5 seconds if unset)
timeout = 5;
# How many bits of sending IP to mask in logs for IPv4 (19 if unset)
ipmask = 19;
# How many bits of sending IP to mask in logs for IPv6 (48 if unset)
ipmask6 = 48;
# Record URL paths? (default false)
full_urls = false;
# This parameter points to a map of domain names
# If a message has a domain in this map in From: header and DKIM signature,
# record general metadata in a table named after the domain
#from_tables = "/etc/rspamd/clickhouse_from.map";
# store digest/hash of email (default false)
enable_digest = false;
# store Symbols.Names, Symbols.Scores, Symbols.Options, Groups.Names and Groups.Scores (default false)
enable_symbols = false;
# These are symbols of other checks in Rspamd
# Set these if you use non-default symbol names (unlikely)
#bayes_spam_symbols = ["BAYES_SPAM"];
#bayes_ham_symbols = ["BAYES_HAM"];
#ann_symbols_spam = {'NEURAL_SPAM'},
#ann_symbols_ham = {'NEURAL_HAM'},
#fuzzy_symbols = ["FUZZY_DENIED"];
#whitelist_symbols = ["WHITELIST_DKIM", "WHITELIST_SPF_DKIM", "WHITELIST_DMARC"];
#dkim_allow_symbols = ["R_DKIM_ALLOW"];
#dkim_reject_symbols = ["R_DKIM_REJECT"];
#dkim_dnsfail_symbols = {'R_DKIM_TEMPFAIL', 'R_DKIM_PERMFAIL'},
#dkim_na_symbols = {'R_DKIM_NA'},
#dmarc_allow_symbols = {'DMARC_POLICY_ALLOW'},
#dmarc_reject_symbols = {'DMARC_POLICY_REJECT'},
#dmarc_quarantine_symbols = {'DMARC_POLICY_QUARANTINE'},
#dmarc_softfail_symbols = {'DMARC_POLICY_SOFTFAIL'},
#dmarc_na_symbols = {'DMARC_NA'},
#spf_allow_symbols = {'R_SPF_ALLOW'},
#spf_reject_symbols = {'R_SPF_FAIL'},
#spf_dnsfail_symbols = {'R_SPF_DNSFAIL', 'R_SPF_PERMFAIL'},
#spf_neutral_symbols = {'R_DKIM_TEMPFAIL', 'R_DKIM_PERMFAIL'},
#spf_na_symbols = {'R_SPF_NA'},
# Subject related (from 1.9)
insert_subject = false; 
# Privacy is off
subject_privacy = false; 
# Default hash-algorithm to obfuscate subject
subject_privacy_alg = 'blake2';
# Prefix to show it's obfuscated
subject_privacy_prefix = 'obf';
# Cut the length of the hash
subject_privacy_length = 16;

# Other options
#database = 'default';
#use_https = false;
# Transport compression
#use_gzip = true;
# Store data for local scanes
#allow_local = false;
# Basic auth
#user = null;
#password = null;
# Disable SSL verification
#no_ssl_verify = false,

# This section configures how long the data will be stored in ClickHouse
#retention {
#  # disabled by default
#  enable = true;
#  # drop | detach, please refer to ClickHouse docs for details
#  # http://clickhouse-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/query_language/queries.html#manipulations-with-partitions-and-parts

# This section defines how often Rspamd will send data to Clickhouse (from 2.1)
#limits {
#  max_rows = 1000; # How many rows are allowed (0 for disable this)
#  max_memory = 50mb; # How many memory should be occupied before sending collection
#  max_interval = 60s; # Maximum collection interval
#}
~~~

### Clickhouse retention

Privacy is important for many email systems. Clickhouse dumps might store client sensitive data. Rspamd supports automatic cleanup of the outdated data using **retention policies**. By default, data is not expired in Clickhouse. However, you can set expiration as following (e.g. to comply with GDPR):

~~~ucl
# local.d/clickhouse.conf
retention {
  enable = true;
  # drop | detach, please refer to ClickHouse docs for details
  # http://clickhouse-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/query_language/queries.html#manipulations-with-partitions-and-parts
  method = "drop";
  # how many month the data should be kept in ClickHouse
  period_months = 3;
  # how often run the cleanup process
  run_every = 7d;
}
~~~

To remove data for particular users, you might consider using of the [Clickhouse mutations](https://clickhouse.yandex/docs/en/query_language/alter/#alter-mutations)

### Subject privacy

Similarly to previous, from the version 1.9, you can store email subject in Clickhouse (disabled by default). Here are settings available:

~~~ucl
insert_subject = false; 
# Privacy is off
subject_privacy = false; 
# Default hash-algorithm to obfuscate subject
subject_privacy_alg = 'blake2';
# Prefix to show it's obfuscated
subject_privacy_prefix = 'obf';
# Cut the length of the hash
subject_privacy_length = 16;
~~~

You can use obfuscated subjects to group messages with a same subject for example.


### Extra columns

You can also extract additional data and add it to a set of extra columns. This feature is available from the version Rspamd 2.4 and Clickhouse 19.3.

~~~ucl
# local.d/clickhouse.conf

extra_columns = {
        Mime_From = {
                selector = "from('mime'):addr";
                type = "String";
                # this is the returning answer if the value is null 
                default_value = "none";
                comment = "Mime from column";
        }
        Mime_Rcpt = {
                selector = "rcpts('mime'):addr";
                type = "Array(String)";
        }
}
~~~

## Clickhouse usage examples

Clickhouse module is extremely useful to perform statistical researches for mail flows. For example, to find top sending domains for spam and ham:

~~~sql
SELECT
    From,
    count() AS c
FROM rspamd
WHERE (Date = today()) AND ((Action = 'reject') OR (Action = 'add header'))
GROUP BY From
ORDER BY c DESC
LIMIT 10

┌─From────────────┬──────c─┐
│ xxx.com         │ 152931 │
│ xxx.com         │ 102123 │
│ gmail.com       │  60865 │
│ yahoo.com       │  58832 │
│ xxx.com         │  58082 │
...
└─────────────────┴────────┘
~~~

Or messages with failed DKIM and DMARC groupped by domain:

~~~sql
SELECT
    From,
    IP,
    count() AS c
FROM rspamd
WHERE (Date = today()) AND (IsDkim = 'reject')
GROUP BY
    From,
    IP
ORDER BY c DESC
LIMIT 10

┌─From─────────────────┬─IP─────────────┬─────c─┐
│ xxx.xxx              │ xx.xx.xx.xx    │ 27542 │
│ xxx.xxx              │ xx.yy.yy.yy    │ 24958 │
...
└──────────────────────┴────────────────┴───────┘
~~~

Or perform some attachments analysis (e.g. top attachments types for Spam):

~~~sql
SELECT
    count() AS c,
    d
FROM rspamd
ARRAY JOIN Attachments.ContentType AS d
WHERE (Date = today()) AND ((Action = 'reject') OR (Action = 'add header'))
GROUP BY d
ORDER BY c DESC
LIMIT 5

┌──────c─┬─d────────────────────────┐
│ ddd    │ image/jpeg               │
│ ddd    │ image/png                │
│ ddd    │ application/octet-stream │
│ ddd    │ image/gif                │
│ ddd    │ application/msword       │
└────────┴──────────────────────────┘
~~~

Rspamd can also send copies of data for specific domains to a separate tables to simplify analytics.

For mailing lists, Rspamd sends list ids which allows to provide very precise statistics for each particular mailing list:

~~~sql
SELECT
    ListId,
    IP,
    count() AS c
FROM rspamd
WHERE (Date = today()) AND (ListId != '')
GROUP BY
    ListId,
    IP
ORDER BY c DESC
LIMIT 10

┌─ListId───────────────────────────────┬─IP──────────────┬──────c─┐
│ xxx                                  │ xx.xx.xx.xx     │ dddd   │
...
└──────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────┴────────┘
~~~

Using extra columns (see [Configuration](https://rspamd.com/doc/modules/clickhouse.html#extra-columns))

~~~sql
SELECT
    From,
    Mime_From,
    Mime_Rcpt
FROM rspamd
WHERE (Date = today())
GROUP BY From
ORDER BY TS From
LIMIT 10

┌─From─────────────────┬─Mime_From─────────────┬─────Mime_Rcpt─────────────┐
│ example@example.com  │ example@example.com   │ ['test@example.com']      │
│ test@test.com        │ hello@test.com        │ ['no@simple.test.com']    │
...
└──────────────────────┴───────────────────────┴───────────────────────────┘
~~~

## URLs storage

This text has been contributed by [Anton Yuzhaninov](https://github.com/citrin)

From version 2.8, Rspamd stores URLs from all sources, together with the corresponding flags.
To differentiate different types we've added `Urls.Flags` column which will contain all flags as an integer. 

All currently used bit flags are listed here:
https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/blob/master/src/libserver/url.h#L17

For example, to exclude `img_src` and `PDF` URLs and keep all other URLs (old behaviour) one needs to exclude Urls where `bit 19` (img) or `bit 21` (content == pdf) are set: `bitTest(Flags, 19)`. If you don't mind having additional urls in `Urls.Url` column you can continue use it as is.

Here are some examples explained:

* The first line (regular_urls) is what has been logged originally;
* The second line - urls from html img tag src attribue
* The third line - urls extracted by content module; currently, it contains only PDF Urls

Numbers `19`, `21`, `22` correspond to flags `RSPAMD_URL_FLAG_IMAGE`, `RSPAMD_URL_FLAG_CONTENT`, `RSPAMD_URL_FLAG_NO_TLD`: https://github.com/rspamd/rspamd/blob/master/src/libserver/url.h#L17

~~~sql
SELECT
       MessageId,
       arrayMap(x -> x.1, arrayFilter(x -> NOT bitTestAny(x.2, 19, 21), arrayZip(Urls.Url, Urls.Flags))) AS regular_urls,
       arrayMap(x -> x.1, arrayFilter(x -> bitTest(x.2, 19), arrayZip(Urls.Url, Urls.Flags))) AS img_src,
       arrayMap(x -> x.1, arrayFilter(x -> bitTest(x.2, 21), arrayZip(Urls.Url, Urls.Flags))) AS pdf_urls
FROM rspamd
WHERE Date = '2021-02-26'
      AND arrayExists(x -> bitTestAny(x, 19, 21, 22), Urls.Flags)
LIMIT 250
~~~

Not all flags are equally interesting, but some are: for example `bitTest(Urls.Flags, 1)` allows much faster select URls with IP than a regexp for `Urls.Url`.
`Bit 20` allows to select for urls that we extract from query args in other urls (e. g. Rspamd extracts `to.com` in `http://example.com/foo?redirect=http://to.com`):

~~~sql
SELECT
       Urls.Tld,
       bitTest(Urls.Flags, 0) AS phished,
       bitTest(Urls.Flags, 1) AS numeric,
       bitTest(Urls.Flags, 4) AS html_disp,
       bitTest(Urls.Flags, 5) AS txt,
       bitTest(Urls.Flags, 6) AS subj,
       bitTest(Urls.Flags, 13) AS has_port,
       bitTest(Urls.Flags, 15) AS no_schema,
       bitTest(Urls.Flags, 16) AS not_norm,
       bitTest(Urls.Flags, 18) AS disp_url,
       bitTest(Urls.Flags, 19) AS img_src,
       bitTest(Urls.Flags, 20) AS from_query,
       bitTest(Urls.Flags, 21) AS pdf,
       bitTest(Urls.Flags, 22) AS no_tld,
       Urls.Flags,
       Urls.Url
FROM rspamd ARRAY JOIN Urls
WHERE Date >= today() - 1 AND TS >= subtractHours(now(), 1)
AND bitTestAny(Urls.Flags, 19, 21)
ORDER BY TS
LIMIT 250
